Weak hashed password

Our home directory is once again empty.
Given the scarcity of information, we can consult /etc/passwd, which contains useful information on groups and users.
That said, /etc/passwd remains a popular 'flag' for security analysts and hackers because it's a traditional "hey, I got what I shouldn't" file. If you can read that, you can read other things under /etc as well

# command for searching 
```
>level01@SnowCrash:~$ cat /etc/passwd 
# Output

flag00:x:3000:3000::/home/flag/flag00:/bin/bash
flag01:42hDRfypTqqnw:3001:3001::/home/flag/flag01:/bin/bash
flag02:x:3002:3002::/home/flag/flag02:/bin/bash
flag03:x:3003:3003::/home/flag/flag03:/bin/bash
flag04:x:3004:3004::/home/flag/flag04:/bin/bash

```
When we display the contents of these /etc/passwd, 
we get what appears to be a A shadow password.

```
So we can log in as flag01 with the password "abcdefg" and use getflag to retrieve the token for level01.
